Tensor Network is a program I'm developing to implement tensor
networks as defined in the physics literature, particularly the
Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA).  A useful
review article from 2011 can be found at [1].

This program compiles by default with clang, libc++, and libtcmalloc.
GNU Scientific Library is *required*, and the unit tests utilize the
Google Test framework and Google Mock.  Currently gsl's internal cblas
is used.  Ideally, this should be replaced with a more optimized
implementation.
