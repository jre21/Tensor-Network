Tensor Network is a program I'm developing to implement tensor
networks as defined in the physics literature, particularly the
Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA).  A useful
review article from 2011 can be found at [1].  The program is in very
early stages, due to lack of time during the school year and my
decision to leave graduate school.

This program compiles by default with clang, libc++, and libtcmalloc.
GNU Scientific Library is *required*, and the unit tests utilize the
Google Test framework and Google Mock.  C++11 constructs are used
extensively throughout this project.  Currently GSL's internal cblas
is used.  Ideally, this should be replaced with a more optimized
implementation.  (In practice, the code has not reached the stage
where the blas library would be hooked in.)
