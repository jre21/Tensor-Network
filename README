Tensor Network is a program I'm developing to implement tensor
networks as defined in the physics literature, particularly the
Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA).  A useful
review article from 2011 can be found at [1].

This program compiles by default with clang, libc++, and libtcmalloc,
and ATLAS.  GNU Scientific Library is *required*, and the unit tests
utilize the Google Test framework and Google Mock.

On a Debian system, all dependencies can be satisfied by installing
the following packages: clang, llvm-dev, libc++-dev, libc++abi-dev,
libgoogle-perftools-dev, libatlas-base-dev, libgsl0dev, google-mock
